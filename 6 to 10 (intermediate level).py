#------Question 06 ---------

# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
# Example
# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
# 100,150,180
# The output of the program should be:
# 18,22,24


import math
c=50
h=30
value = []
items=[x for x in input('Enter Values with Comma Separation: ').split(',')]
for d in items:
    value.append(str(int(round(math.sqrt(2*c*float(d)/h)))))

print(','.join(value))


#------Question 07 ---------

# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
# Example
# Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
# 3,5
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

input_str = input('Enter two disgits: ')
dimensions=[int(x) for x in input_str.split(',')]

multilist = [[0 for col in range(colNum)] for row in range(rowNum)]

for row in range(rowNum):
    for col in range(colNum):
        multilist[row][col]= row*col

print(multilist)


#------Question 08 ---------

# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world

items=[x for x in input('Enter Comma separated words: ').split(',')]
items.sort()
print(','.join(items))


#------Question 09 ---------

# Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# Hello world
# Practice makes perfect
# Then, the output should be:
# HELLO WORLD
# PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT


lines = []
while True:
    s = input()
    if s:
        lines.append(s.upper())
    else:
        break;

for sentence in lines:
    print(sentence)


#------Question 10 ---------

# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be:
# again and hello makes perfect practice world

s = input()
words = [word for word in s.split(" ")]
print(" ".join(sorted(list(set(words)))))
