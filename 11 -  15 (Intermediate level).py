#------Question 11 ---------

# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
# Example:
# 0100,0011,1010,1001
# Then the output should be:
# 1010


value = []
items=[x for x in input().split(',')]
for p in items:
    intp = int(p, 2)
    if not intp%5:
        value.append(p)

print(','.join(value))



#------Question 12 ---------

# Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

values = []
for i in range(1000, 3001):
    s = str(i)
    if (int(s[0])%2==0) and (int(s[1])%2==0) and (int(s[2])%2==0) and (int(s[3])%2==0):
        values.append(s)
print(",".join(values))


#------Question 13 ---------


# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world! 123

#------Question 14 ---------


# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

#------Question 15 ---------

# Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.
