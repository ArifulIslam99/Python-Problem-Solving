# Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
# D 100
# W 200

# D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# D 300
# D 300
# W 200
# D 100
# Then, the output should be:
# 500

#------Question 18 ---------

# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# 2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
# 1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# 3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
# 4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# 5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
# Example
# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
# ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# ABd1234@1

#------Question 19 ---------

# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
# 1: Sort based on name;
# 2: Then sort based on age;
# 3: Then sort by score.
# The priority is that name > age > score.
# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
# Tom,19,80
# John,20,90
# Jony,17,91
# Jony,17,93
# Json,21,85
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

# A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3

# The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.

# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# Then, the output of the program should be:2
